I would like to add some views for Casper and Derecho charging.  The
charging logic can vary by machine and also by queue.  I would like to
track node hours, CPU hours, GPU hours, and Memory hours as virtual
columns in these views.

The logic for creating the views could be in raw SQL or ORMS,
depending on which is easier.  What is important is that it supports
different charging schemes by system and by queue.

I would then like to use these charging views to create a daily
summary table, where for a given day the total number of jobs and
charges per user on a given account are readily stored for fast
retrieval.

Finally, I would like to extend the sync command to inspect these
summary tables to determine which days have already been processed, and
skip those days when syncing a range.  This will prevent downloading
large amounts of data in qhist only to skip the duplicates when
updating the jobs table.

Please develop a plan with these goals in mind, considering any
refactoring opportunities for simplification of the current code for
long term maintainability.
